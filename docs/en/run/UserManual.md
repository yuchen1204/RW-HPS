### Download and Install Plugins

A newly installed RW-HPS does not have any custom functions. The functions will be provided by plugins.

### Using Mods

Just put the mods into `data/mods`!

### Using Maps

#### Custom Maps

Put the maps into `data/maps`, then refer to [How to Switch Maps](#how-to-switch-maps).

#### Using Saved Games

Change the file extension to `.save`, put it into `data/maps`, then refer to [How to Switch Maps](#how-to-switch-maps).

#### How to Switch Maps

Type `.maps` in the client chat box to view the maps in effect on the server.  
You will find a number ID in front of each name.  
Type `.map + space + ID` in the client chat box to switch to your custom map.  
**Note: After switching maps, the host's map display might have issues, this is normal and doesn't require any action.**  
**To switch back to the original version, just select one of the host's original maps.**
